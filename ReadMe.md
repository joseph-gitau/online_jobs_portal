**Welcome to the Online Jobs Portal!**

This it's a web application built with PHP, HTML, CSS, and JS with the help of some JS libraries such as Sweetalert, jQuery, Chosen, and WaitMe. The application allows employers to post job opportunities and interested and qualified persons to apply for the job opportunities posted. Users can sign up and create their profile as an employer or an employee which will then require verification from the admin.
